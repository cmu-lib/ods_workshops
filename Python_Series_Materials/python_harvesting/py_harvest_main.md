# Python for Harvesting Data on the Web

This is an intermediate-to-advanced level Python workshop that describes ways to approach common data wrangling from the web for research needs. We will focus on obtaining open data sources through HTTP requests and then demonstrate how to access larger sources of data via APIs. Then we will show how to turn the retrieved data into more useful objects like data frames to do basic manipulations and analysis. This workshop is only recommended for Python users with familiarity in Pandas, Numpy, core Python objects (lists, dictionaries, strings, numbers), file types like JSON and CSV, and comfort using Jupyter Notebooks.

**Date:** Wednesday, April 19, 2023                                           
**Time:** 10:00am - 12:00pm EST                                        
**Location:**  Virtual Workshop - This is a virtual event. A URL to participate will be sent via a reminder email 24 hours before the event.

### Goals of this Workshop

This workshop will provide learners the basic approaches to extract information
from the web using Python. The topics covered will give learners enough ground
knowledge to harvest information from a several web sources.

### Setup

To be best prepared for this workshop, please make sure you have
[Python Installed](../setup#installing-python-using-anaconda),preferably with
the Anaconda distribution prior to attending. You may also install some of the
libraries we will be using ahead of time:

- urllib
- beautifulsoup4
- MechanicalSoup
- sodapy

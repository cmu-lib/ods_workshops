title: "For Loops"
teaching: 10
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How can I make a program do many things?"
objectives:
- "Explain what for loops are normally used for."
- "Trace the execution of a simple (unnested) loop and correctly state the values of variables in each iteration."
- "Write for loops that use the Accumulator pattern to aggregate values."
keypoints:
- "A *for loop* executes commands once for each value in a collection."
- "A `for` loop is made up of a collection, a loop variable, and a body."
- "The first line of the `for` loop must end with a colon, and the body must be indented."
- "Indentation is always meaningful in Python."
- "Loop variables can be called anything (but it is strongly advised to have a meaningful name to the looping variable)."
- "The body of a loop can contain many statements."
- "Use `range` to iterate over a sequence of numbers."
- "The Accumulator pattern turns many values into one."

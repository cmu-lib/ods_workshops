# Introduction to Command Line Interface
This is a hands-on introduction to using the command line interface. This workshop is designed for those who are beginning their exploration into command line programming and anyone seeking to refresh their skills. Command line interface (CLI) is a quick and efficient way to perform computing tasks. A few of the topics that will be introduced include navigating the directory structure, commonly used commands, working with files and directories, and more. For this workshop youâ€™ll need access to Bash Shell. If you use MacOS or Linux then you should have Bash already installed. For those on Windows OS you may need to install a bash shell. [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org) installation is one option for installing Bash Shell.

### Goals of this Workshop
The goal of this workshop is to introduce beginner users of the command line interface to basic concepts and commands for navigating and working with files and directories.  Learners will understand how to move around their directories using commands like `pwd`, `cd`, and `ls`; work with directories to create new directories, and access the text editor, including moving, making copies, and removing files; use pipe and filters to view word counts, filter files using `sort` and `cat` and combine commands.

## Citizen Science Lesson: Advanced Data Cleaning

In this activity set, we will be:

* Create a new project from the citizen science dataset and use the clustering feature
* Split and concatenate various columns in the dataset
* Restructure the dataset by removing columns and rows, and then work with Undo/Redo to roll those changes back
* Export a JSON script to perform the same process on another dataset
* Shutting down OpenRefine

If you haven't already, download [the workshop files](https://github.com/cmu-lib/portfolio_workshop/blob/main/OpenRefine_Materials/files/20201001_OpenRefine_Workshop_files.zip?raw=true) and save them in a folder on your desktop. Make sure to extract the files from the zip file.

[Let's get started!](https://cmu-lib.github.io/portfolio_workshop/OpenRefine_Materials/pt2_citizen_science/02_clustering.html)

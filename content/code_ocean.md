# Encapsulating Reproducible Computational Research with Code Ocean  
Hosted by the [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Libraries](https://www.library.cmu.edu/)

## About this workshop

[Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/) is a cloud-based platform for creating, organizing, and sharing reproducible computational research environments. In this workshop, we will show you how to create a "Capsule" for a computational research project. We will demonstrate how to organize data, code, and results in a Capsule, create a reproducible snapshot of a software environment for a variety of programming languages and libraries (including Python, R, MATLAB, and Julia), and create metadata to prepare your project for publication and enhanced discoverability. This workshop is open to anyway that is interested in computational reproducibility. No prior experience with a programming language is required, but we encourage participants to attend with a project in mind, so that they are able to immediately utilize this platform.

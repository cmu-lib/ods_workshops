# Advanced Research Note-Taking with Obsidian

This workshop will introduce Obsidian, a markdown-based note-taking app that
helps you organize your personal knowledge base. We will demonstrate how to
create and edit markdown files to easily format your notes, then dive in to
several of the functions and plug-ins in Obsidian that makes it easier for you
to organize, link, and search your recorded thoughts. Finally, we will
demonstrate how you can link Obsidian to Zotero to help you connect research
notes to items in your bibliography.  

**Date:** March 22, 2023   
**Time:** 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm   
**Location:** The Den, Sorrells Library

### Goal of this Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to introduce users to a tool that organizes their
personal notes or notes related to research. This workshop will show many of
the advanced functionalities offered in Obsidian and outline a workflow to sync
a Zotero library with Obsidian, so that notes can be directly linked to entries
in a bibliography.

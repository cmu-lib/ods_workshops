# Cleaning Untidy Data with OpenRefine
Hosted by the [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Libraries](https://www.library.cmu.edu/)

## About this Workshop

Tired of spending hours and hours cleaning messy data in Excel spreadsheets? Come learn [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/), an easy-to-use, open source tool for data cleaning. OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) helps you prepare your data for analysis. 

Quickly and easily transform data, split and merge columns, remove whitespace, and perform many more common data cleaning tasks. With OpenRefine, you can also easily create JSON scripts for repeating series of tasks across multiple datasets.

No previous experience is required. This will be a hands-on workshop--please bring a laptop.

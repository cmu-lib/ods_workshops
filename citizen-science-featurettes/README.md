# Citizen Science Featurettes
Ever dreamed of being an astrophysicist for a day? A biochemist? A geographer?... Now you can! Come discover the weird, wild, wonderful world of citizen science with our new *Citizen Science Featurettes*! 

Citizen Science Featurettes are a series of one-off, half-day events designed to expose participants to the diversity of citizen science opportunities at CMU, in the local community, and on the web. Each Featurette centers on a single citizen science project and includes: 
- Orientation and training in the project’s methodology
- A hands-on “field-test” of the project interface and workflow
- A debrief and discussion highlighting key insights, opportunities, and challenges
